# Stashkit
Exposes MongoDB GridFS via a RESTful Interface backed by ImageMagick and FFMPEG

##Goal
- To create a file storage service with the same interface as Amazon S3 which you can host in your own server
- Query Image and Video files using ImageMagick and FFMPEG respectively to do transformations on the fly
